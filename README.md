🎨 LED-style glowing red display using a digital font

🧮 Buttons for +1, +2, and +3 point increments

🔁 Reset (Refresh) button to restart both scores

💻 Fully responsive and easy to customize

🛠️ Setup Instructions

Clone or download this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scoreboard.git


Open the project folder:

cd scoreboard


Open index.html in your browser — no installation required!

🧠 How It Works

Each side (Home and Guest) has three buttons to add 1, 2, or 3 points.

When a button is clicked, the JavaScript functions in index.js update the corresponding score displayed in real time.

The glowing digital style is achieved through CSS text-shadows and the VT323 font from Google Fonts.

The “Refresh” button resets both scores to zero.

🎨 Technologies Used

HTML5 – structure

CSS3 – styling and digital LED effects

JavaScript (ES6) – logic and interactivity

Google Fonts (VT323) – digital-style font

🧰 Customization

You can easily modify:

Colors (change the LED glow in index.css)

Font (swap out VT323 for any Google Font)

Layout (adjust padding or button placement)
